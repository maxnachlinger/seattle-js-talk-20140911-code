Silly [HapiJS](http://hapijs.com/) / [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) app to accompany my rambling l10n talk at SeattleJS.

### Installation:
```
npm i
```
Run the bit below and hit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
```
node index.js
```
### Generate a POT file as well as an EN and test PO file:
```
grunt
```
### Etc.
This app uses my silly [hapi-l10n-gettext](https://github.com/maxnachlinger/hapi-l10n-gettext) plug-in to load and parse PO files etc.
